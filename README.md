# Brain-Tumor-Classification
Developed a robust machine learning model for brain tumor detection, achieving 85% accuracy and employing bounding boxes to accurately highlight the tumor's location. 
Extended the application of these techniques to detect ovarian and hepatic cancers, with clear visual indicators of the affected areas. 
This project underscores the transformative potential of advanced computer vision technologies in improving early detection and diagnostic precision in critical healthcare applications. 

**Tools**: Python programming, Sci-Kit Learn, and OpenCV.
