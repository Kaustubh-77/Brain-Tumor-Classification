# Brain-Tumor-Classification
Developed a robust machine learning model for brain tumor detection, achieving 85% accuracy and employing bounding boxes to accurately highlight the tumor's location. 
developed two models, SVC with accuracy of 86% and Logistic regression with accuracy of 82%.
The input is MRI tumor scans.
This project underscores the transformative potential of advanced computer vision technologies in improving early detection and diagnostic precision in critical healthcare applications. 

**Tools**: Python programming, Sci-Kit Learn, and OpenCV.
